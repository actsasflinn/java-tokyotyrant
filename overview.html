<h1>Java Binding of Tokyo Tyrant.</h1>

<div>Tokyo Tyrant is a modern implementation of DBM.</div>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Tokyo Tyrant is a library of routines for managing a database.  The database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or fixed-length array.</p>

<p>As for database of hash table, each key must be unique within a database, so it is impossible to store two or more records with a key overlaps.  The following access methods are provided to the database: storing a record with a key and a value, deleting a record by a key, retrieving a record by a key.  Moreover, traversal access to every key are provided, although the order is arbitrary.  These access methods are similar to ones of DBM (or its followers: NDBM and GDBM) library defined in the UNIX standard.  Tokyo Tyrant is an alternative for DBM because of its higher performance.</p>

<p>As for database of B+ tree, records whose keys are duplicated can be stored.  Access methods of storing, deleting, and retrieving are provided as with the database of hash table.  Records are stored in order by a comparison function assigned by a user.  It is possible to access each record with the cursor in ascending or descending order.  According to this mechanism, forward matching search for strings and range search for integers are realized.</p>

<p>As for database of fixed-length array, records are stored with unique natural numbers.  It is impossible to store two or more records with a key overlaps.  Moreover, the length of each record is limited by the specified length.  Provided operations are the same as ones of hash database.</p>

<p>Table database is also provided as a variant of hash database.  Each record is identified by the primary key and has a set of named columns.  Although there is no concept of data schema, it is possible to search for records with complex conditions efficiently by using indices of arbitrary columns.</p>

<h2>Setting</h2>

<p>Install the latest version of Tokyo Tyrant beforehand and get the package of the Java binding of Tokyo Tyrant.</p>

<p>Enter the directory of the extracted package then perform installation.</p>

<pre style="margin: 0em 0.8em; padding: 0.3em; background: #eeeeff none; border: 1px solid #cccccc; font-size: 90%;">./configure
make
make check
su
make install
</pre>

<p>When a series of work finishes, the JAR file `tokyotyrant.jar' and the shared object files `libjtokyotyrant.so' and so on are installed under `/usr/local/lib'.</p>

<p>Let the class search path include `/usr/local/lib/tokyotyrant.jar' and let the library search path include `/usr/local/lib'.</p>

<pre style="margin: 0em 0.8em; padding: 0.3em; background: #eeeeff none; border: 1px solid #cccccc; font-size: 90%;">CLASSPATH="$CLASSPATH:/usr/local/lib/tokyotyrant.jar"
LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib"
export CLASSPATH LD_LIBRARY_PATH
</pre>

<p>The above settings can be specified by options of the runtime command.</p>

<pre style="margin: 0em 0.8em; padding: 0.3em; background: #eeeeff none; border: 1px solid #cccccc; font-size: 90%;">java -cp tokyotyrant.jar -Djava.library.path=. FooBarBaz ...
</pre>

<p>All symbols of Tokyo Tyrant are defined in the package `tokyotyrant'.  You can access them without any prefix by importing the package.</p>

<pre style="margin: 0em 0.8em; padding: 0.3em; background: #eeeeff none; border: 1px solid #cccccc; font-size: 90%;">import tokyotyrant.*;
</pre>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>The following code is an example to use a table database.</p>

<pre style="margin: 0em 0.8em; padding: 0.3em; background: #eeeeff none; border: 1px solid #cccccc; font-size: 90%;">import tokyotyrant.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TCRDBEX {
  public static void main(String[] args){

    // create the object
    TCRDB tdb = new TCRDB();

    // open the database
    if(!tdb.open("127.0.0.1", 1978)){
      int ecode = tdb.ecode();
      System.err.println("open error: " + tdb.errmsg(ecode));
    }

    // store a record
    String pkey = new Long(tdb.genuid()).toString();
    Map cols = new HashMap();
    cols.put("name", "mikio");
    cols.put("age", "30");
    cols.put("lang", "ja,en,c");
    if(!tdb.put(pkey, cols)){
      int ecode = tdb.ecode();
      System.err.println("put error: " + tdb.errmsg(ecode));
    }

    // store another record
    cols = new HashMap();
    cols.put("name", "falcon");
    cols.put("age", "31");
    cols.put("lang", "ja");
    cols.put("skill", "cook,blog");
    if(!tdb.put("x12345", cols)){
      int ecode = tdb.ecode();
      System.err.println("put error: " + tdb.errmsg(ecode));
    }

    // search for records
    RDBQRY qry = new RDBQRY(tdb);
    qry.addcond("age", RDBQRY.QCNUMGE, "20");
    qry.addcond("lang", RDBQRY.QCSTROR, "ja,en");
    qry.setorder("name", RDBQRY.QOSTRASC);
    qry.setlimit(10, 0);
    List res = qry.search();
    Iterator it = res.iterator();
    while(it.hasNext()){
      String rkey = new String((byte[])it.next());
      Map rcols = tdb.get(rkey);
      System.out.println("name:" + rcols.get("name"));
    }

    // close the database
    if(!tdb.close()){
      int ecode = tdb.ecode();
      System.err.println("close error: " + tdb.errmsg(ecode));
    }

  }
}
</pre>
